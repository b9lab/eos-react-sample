This project contains a sample eosio react application, built in our [eosio free course on B9lab Academy](https://academy.b9lab.com/). It is only a sample and should not be used as a template for a production application! It's main purpose is to demonstrate one possible approach to use react for a simple eosio app, concentrating on the actual eosio interaction and simplifying the surroundings.
