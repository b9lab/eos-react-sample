This project contains a sample eosio react application, built in our [eosio free course on B9lab Academy](https://academy.b9lab.com/courses/course-v1:B9lab+EOSIO-FREE+2018-09/about). It demonstrates how to interact with a smart contract using the [eosjs library](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs) through a UI build with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

It is just an example to illustrate basic interaction, neglecting account selection, error handling, etc.
